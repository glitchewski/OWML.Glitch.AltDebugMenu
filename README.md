# Cheat And Debug Menu for Outer Wilds Mod Loader

Thanks for using my Cheat and Debug Menu mod.
Here's a list of keybinds available (they're not rebindable currently) and some basic help.

## Basic Functionalities

| Key | Description |
| :-: | --- |
`` ` `` | Show/hide mod GUI (timer and current warp point) (it's backquote, left of key 1)
`F1`    | Show/hide game GUI (air, fuel, direction, whatnot)
`F2`    | Add/remove space suit
`F3`    | Learn launch codes
`F4`    | Refill resources/health
`F7`    | Toggle invincibility
`F11`   | Toggle clipping (for Hatchling or for ship, depending if you're sitting in the cockpit) (usually makes everything float away since the planets are always on the move)
`=`     | Fast forward (equals sign) (also allows to fast forward the mask at the end of the loop)
`Num8` | Superpowered industrial flashlight on/off
`Num9` | Turn Stranger's artificial sun on/off
`Del`  | Force flashlight on (useful whenever you can't turn it on with `F` key)

Following can be used to change jetpack/ship boost power (depending if you're sitting in the cockpit) by the magnitude of 50% (or 1000% if you hold `Num0` first, go crazy).
| Key | Description |
| :-: | --- |
`Num+` | Increase boost power
`Num-` | Decrease boost power

## Basic Warp Functionalities

You need to hold either warp modifier A or B (A takes precedence) to use warp keys, as they overlap with tool keybindings

| Key | Description |
| :-: | --- |
`-` | Warp Modifier B (minus sign)
`P` | Warp Modifier A

While holding modifier A or B:
| Key | Description |
| :-: | --- |
`1` | A: Comet /  B: Sun Station
`2` | A: Twin One / B: Twin Two
`3` | A: Timber Hearth / B: Alternate location on TH
`4` | A: Brittle Hollow
`5` | A: Giants Deep
`6` | A: Dark Bramble
`7` | A: Quantum Moon
`8` | A: Attlerock Moon Lookout / B: Signal Locator
`9` | A: Stranger's dock / B: Stranger near lamp laboratory
`0` | A: your Ship

## Advanced Warp Functionalities

Currently active warp point is visible in mod GUI (press backslash (`` ` ``) key to see it)
| Key | Description |
| :-: | --- |
`[` | (left bracket) select previous warp point
`]` | (right bracket) select next warp point
`\` | (backslash) warp to selected (NOTE! on UK keyboard layout that's the tilde (`~`) key)

## Memory Warp Functionalities
If you press just the (warp memory) button, you'll warp to corresponding location (given that you've saved it first). To save the location to memory, hold the (set to memory) button and then press corresponding (warp memory) button.
| Key | Description |
| :-: | --- |
`Num0` | set to memory
`Num1` | warp memory 1
`Num2` | warp memory 2
`Num3` | warp memory 3
