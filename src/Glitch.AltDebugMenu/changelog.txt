[0.4.0] minor update
New features:
- added option to turn on/off Stranger lights
Fixes:
- added warp modifier A/B (so you need to hold one of those to warp, otherwise they overlap with tool keybinds)
Other:
- rewritten readme.txt so it's more understandable
- added changelog.txt (hopefully I'll remember to keep this up to date)

[prior to 0.4.0]
- everything else, basically
