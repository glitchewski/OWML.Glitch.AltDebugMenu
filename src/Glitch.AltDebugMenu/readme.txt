Here's a list of keybinds available (they're not rebindable currently).

BASIC KEYS
Backquote (`) - shows/hides mod GUI
F1 - shows/hides game GUI
F2 - add/remove space suit
F3 - learn launch codes
F4 - refill resources
F7 - toggle invincibility
F11 - toggle clipping (acts weird since universe is always on the move!)
Equals (=) - fast forward (allows to skip the mask at end of loop too)

BASIC WARP
Keys 1 to 0			- different warp points or to be exact:
	1 - Comet / Sun Station
	2 - Twins One / Two
	3 - Timber Hearth / Alternate location on TH
	4 - Brittle Hollow
	5 - Giants Deep
	6 - Dark Bramble
	7 - Quantum Moon
	8 - Attlerock Moon Lookout / Signal Dish
	9 - Stranger / Alternate location on Stranger
	0 - your Ship
Minus (-)			- warp modifier
Basically if you press keys from 1 to 0 you warp to different planets, if you first hold minus key and then any of the 1 to 0 keys, you should warp to alternate location if available.

ADVANCED WARP
Left bracket ([) - select previous warp point
Right bracket (]) - select next warp point
Backslash (\) - warp to selected
Selected warp point should be visible in mod GUI (press ~ to see it)

MEMORY WARP
Numpad 1 - warp to point 1
Numpad 2 - warp to point 2
Numpad 3 - warp to point 3
Numpad 0 - set mode
If you press Num 1 - 3, you warp to saved locations. You save locations by holding Num 0 and then pressing one of three memory keys (Num 1 to Num 3).
